# Code Busters

[CodinGame Challenge](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/codebusters)

This is an implementation for a GhostBusters inspired challenge where the game agents are
capturing ghosts on a 2 dimensional plane. The ghosts are randomly placed, and the agents
need to get in distance to fire their weapons.

Two teams are competing to bust the most ghosts in the same arena
